# Implement-Multipath-Model-for-Communication-in-Wireless-channel
Implementation of Bit Error Rate for multipath models like AWGN, Rayleigh, and Rician Fading Channel models under BPSK Modulation Scheme.

## Results and Discussions
From the simulation results, The Bit Error Ratio of a digital communication system is an important figure of merit used to quantify the integrity of data transmitted through the system. The criterion is comparison of the variation of BER for different SNR. It is observed that the BER is minimum for AWGN and maximum for RAYLEIGH. 
From the figures we can see that the AWGN channel has lower BER than different
fading channels. The Rayleigh fading channel has higher BER than Rician and AWGN
fading channels. The Rician fading channel has BER between the AWGN and Rayleigh
channels.



## Simualation Table and Observations
This section we present and evaluate the results using the Matlab. The results are used
the ratio of signal energy per bit to noise power density SNR(ùê∏ùëè/ùëÅ0) and bit error rate
BER to evaluate and analyse the performance of BPSK over AWGN, Rician, and
Rayleigh fading channels.
