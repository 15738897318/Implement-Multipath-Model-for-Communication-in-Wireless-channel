# Implement-Multipath-Model-for-Communication-in-Wireless-channel
Implementation of Bit Error Rate for multipath models like AWGN, Rayleigh, and Rician Fading Channel models under BPSK Modulation Scheme.

## Results and Discussions
From the simulation results, The Bit Error Ratio of a digital communication system is an important figure of merit used to quantify the integrity of data transmitted through the system. The criterion is comparison of the variation of BER for different SNR. It is observed that the BER is minimum for AWGN and maximum for RAYLEIGH. In this project, we Implemented Bit Error Rate for multipath models like AWGN, Rayleigh, and Rician Fading Channel models under BPSK Modulation Scheme.
